This assignment was to learn how to use readelf to read and discern how executables are organized.  
My executable entry point (_start) is at 0x400450. The data information is as follows:

(non optimized)
.text is 0x04e8 big and loaded at the entry point (0x0400450)
.rodata is 0x087 big and is at 0x0400948
.data is 0x04 big and is at 0x0600d50
.bss is 0x0fc0 big and is at 0x0600d60

(Optimized)
.text is 0x0428 big and loaded at the entry point (0x0400450)
.rodata is 0x08b big and is at 0x0400888
.data is 0x04 big and is at 0x0600c80
.bss is 0x0fc0 big and is at 0x0600ca0

Now looking at the symbol table, you can see my functions and their sizes and locations.
(non-optimized)

.Partition. is loaded at 0x0400571 and its size is 128 
.Bubble. is loaded at 0x04005f1 and its size is 143
.quicksort. is loaded at 0x400528 and its size is 73
.swap. is loaded at 0x04006f5 and its size is 80 
.selectionsort. is loaded at 0x0400680 and its size is 117
.main. is loaded at 0x0400745 and its size is 273 

(Optimized)
.Partition. is loaded at 0x0400620 and its size is 77 
.Bubble. is loaded at 0x04005b0 and its size is 102
.quicksort. is loaded at 0x400670 and its size is 78
.swap. is loaded at 0x0400530 and its size is 35
.selectionsort. is loaded at 0x0400560 and its size is 72
.main. is loaded at 0x04006c0 and its size is 216 



As for the library functions, there are two used from stdio.h. They are as follows:
Printf@@GLIBC_2.2.5 is not loaded at an address and its size is 162
ScanF@@GLIBC_2.2.5 is not loaded at an address and its size is 164

After optimization, the entry point did not change. However, above you can see the text section 
size went from 0x04e8 to 0x0428 after optimizing and in the symbol table you can see that the 
function sizes shrunk (except for .quicksort).
