 #INCLUDE <STDIO.H>
C DOCUMENTATION NORMALLY REFERS TO THESE FUNCTIONS AS PERFORMING "STREAM I/O", NOT "FILE I/O". 
THE DISTINCTION IS THAT THEY COULD JUST AS WELL HANDLE DATA BEING TRANSFERRED THROUGH A MODEM 
AS A FILE, AND SO THE MORE GENERAL TERM "DATA STREAM" IS USED RATHER THAN "FILE". HOWEVER, 
WE'LL STAY WITH THE "FILE" TERMINOLOGY IN THIS DOCUMENT FOR THE SAKE OF SIMPLICITY.
* THE "FOPEN()" FUNCTION OPENS AND, IF NEED BE, CREATES A FILE. ITS SYNTAX IS:

   <FILE POINTER> = FOPEN( <FILENAME>, <ACCESS MODE> );
THE "FOPEN()" FUNCTION RETURNS A "FILE POINTER", DECLARED AS FOLLOWS:
   FILE *<FILE POINTER>;
THE FILE POINTER WILL BE RETURNED WITH THE VALUE NULL, DEFINED IN "STDIO.H", IF THERE IS AN 
ERROR. THE "ACCESS MODES" ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS:
   R     OPEN FOR READING.
   W     OPEN AND WIPE (OR CREATE) FOR WRITING.
   A     APPEND -- OPEN (OR CREATE) TO WRITE TO END OF FILE.
   R+    OPEN A FILE FOR READING AND WRITING.
   W+    OPEN AND WIPE (OR CREATE) FOR READING AND WRITING.
   A+    OPEN A FILE FOR READING AND APPENDING.
THE "FILENAME" IS SIMPLY A STRING OF CHARACTERS.
