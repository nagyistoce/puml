Test: pUML object functionality			Risk Level: MED

  Test Steps (input):
       1. Open a new diagram
    2. Click on an object in the toolbar.
    3. Click on the canvas. An object should appear at that location.
    4. A properties dialog box should appear.
    5. Type the object description in the box and click the Ok button
    6. The description you typed should appear inside the object.
    7. Right-click on the object. A context menu should appear.
    8. Select Properties from the context menu.
    9. The properties dialog box should appear, with the text you just typed highlighted.
    10. Type a very long description such as "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and click Ok.
    11. The object should resize to accept the new description.
    12. Change the description of the object 8 more times.
    13. Click on the select tool.
    14. Click on the object. It should appear highlighted ("selected")
    15. Click on the object and drag it across the canvas. It should move with the mouse cursor.
    16. Click on the canvas in an area away from the object.  The object should de-select
    17. Create 10 other objects on the canvas, away from the initial object.
    18. Click on one of the inter-object connectors in the tool bar.
    19. Draw a connection line between each of the 10 new objects and the initial object.
    20. The object should accept all 10 connectors.
    21. Right-click on the object and select Delete from the context menu.
    22. The object, its description, and all attached connectors should be deleted.

  Expected Results:
    Objects can be created, deleted, selected, moved, deselected, and accept connectors.
    Object descriptions can be modified, and the object will resize to accept the new description.
     

***** ALPHA TEST *****

Change Set#: Rev 351		Date of Test: 4/19/12		
Pass/Fail: Pass

Tester Name: Jeremy Klas

Log: 
The object could be created, selected, modified, moved, and deleted just fine. It also accepted connectors and its data was modifiable.

Extraneous Observations: 
The test ran great, however with that many connectors going into a single object the diagram began to get cluttered around the four north, south, west, east connection points.
