Test: pUML connector functionality		Risk Level: MED 

  Test Steps (input):
    1. Open a new diagram
    2. Place any two objects on the canvas.
    3. Click on an inter-object connector line
    4. Click on the canvas away from any objects. 
    5. Nothing should happen.
    6. Click on one object and release.
    7. A warning dialog should appear stating "No second object selected."
    8. Click within the boundaries of the first object, and drag the mouse to within the boundaries of the second object.  Release the mouse button.
    9. A connector should be placed between the two objects.
    10. If a dialog for the connector appears at this time, click Cancel.
    11. Click on the connector line. It should appear highlighted ("selected").
    12. Right-click on the connector line. A context menu should appear. 
    13. Select Properties from the context menu. A dialog should appear.
    14. Enter text in the Description field of this dialog, and click Ok.
    15. The description you entered should appear next to the connector line.
    16. Change the connector's description 9 more times.
    17. Right-click on the connector line again and select Delete from the context menu.
    18. The connector and its description should disappear.
    19. Place a third object on the canvas directly between the first and second objects. 
    20. Try to draw a connector between the first and second objects again. 
    21. The connector should draw a line between the first and second objects. It does not connect to the object between the two.
    22. Click on Select, right click on the middle object, and press delete.  There should only be the two objects and a connector between them now.
    23. Click on the connector. It should appear highlighted. Hold down the left mouse button and try to drag the connector.  It should not move.
    24. Click on the canvas away from the objects or connector. The connector's highlight should disappear ("deselect").
    25. Click on the same connector line in the toolbar again. 
    26. Try to draw another connector between the first and second objects again. 
    27. Nothing should happen.
    28. Click Select in the toolbar.
    29. Click on the second object and drag it across the canvas.
    30. The connector line should remain attached to both objects as it moves.
    31. The connector's description should move with the object.
    32. Right click on the connector and select Delete from the context menu.
    33. The connector line and its description should disappear.


  Expected Results:
    A connector may be placed one time between two and only two objects
    It may be selected, deselected, moved with objects, and its description may be modified.
