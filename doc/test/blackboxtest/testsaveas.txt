***** ALPHA TEST *****

Change Set#: 361		Date of Test: 4/22/12		
Pass/Fail: Fail

Tester Name: Brian Bowles

Log: Failed and stopped at step 7 because loading is broken.

Extraneous Observations:
Step 4: filename prompt comes up as "XML files (*.xml)" with "XML files (*" preselected so the extention has an extra ")".
Step 6: Close tab does nothing.

If "open" is chosen when program is launched, after the popup says opening isn't implimented yet, we get a blank canvas with all node option and connectors available.
