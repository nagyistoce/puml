Test: pUML self-connector functionality		Risk Level: MED


NOTE: THE FOLLOWING TEST ONLY APPLIES TO COLLABORATION AND STATE DIAGRAMS
 
  Test Steps (input):
    1. Open a new diagram.
    2. Click on an object from the toolbar and place it on the canvas.
    3. Click on the self-connector from the toolbar.
    4. Click on the canvas away from the object. Nothing should happen.
    5. Click on the object.  A connector line should appear looping from the object back to the object.
    6. If a dialog appears at this time, ignore it by clicking Cancel.
    7. Click on the object again. Nothing should happen.
    8. Click on an object from the toolbar and place a second object on the canvas.
    9. Click on the self-connector from the toolbar and drag the mouse from the first object to the second object. Nothing should happen.
    10. Right-click on the self-connector. A context menu should appear.
    11. Select "Delete" from the context menu. The self-connector should disappear.
    12. (Self-connector should still be selected on the toolbar) Drag the mouse from the first object to the second object.  A connector line should appear looping from the first object back to the first object.
    13. Right-click on the self-connector.
    14. Select "Properties" from the context menu. A Properties dialog should appear.
    15. Type a description for the object and click Ok. The description should appear next to the self-connector line.
    16. Change the description for the self-connector 9 more times.
    17. Click on Select in the toolbar and click on the self-connector.  
    18. It should appear highlighted ("selected").
    19. Try to drag the self-connector away from the object. 
    20. Nothing should happen.
    21. Click on the canvas away from the object and self-connector. 
    22. The highlight effect should disappear from the self-connnector ("deselected").
    23. Click on the object and drag it across the canvas.
    24. The self-connector should move with the object.
    25. Right-click on the self-connector.
    26. Select "Delete" from the context menu.
    27. The self-connector and its description should disappear.

  Expected Results:
    Only one self-connector can connect to only one object.
    Its properties may be modified, and it may be moved with objects and deleted.
    

***** ALPHA TEST *****

Change Set#: 346	Date of Test: 4/3/2011	
Pass/Fail: PASS

Tester Name: Maxine Major

Log: 
  All Steps completed in sequence with no errors.


Extraneous Observations: 
  No errors reported.
  The only diagram type with a self-connector at this time 
is the Collaboration diagram.



***** BETA TEST *****

Change Set#: Rev 351		Date of Test: 4/19/2011
Pass/Fail: Pass

Tester Name: Jeremy Klas 

Log: 
  All of the steps were completed and worked as explained.

Extraneous Observations: 
  Although the test worked, there is an issue with placing multiple self connectors to an object.
  If you accidentally click on an object twice with the self connector, two connectors are drawn,
  this becomes an issue when adding text or when deleting. If you're deleting you are required to
  do multiple deletions to see the desired result, and when adding text, the text of each line
  write over each other making each unlegible.
