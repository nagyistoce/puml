<h3> Passing CS 384: a (Simplified!) Checklist </h3>

<font size=2>
Please turn this in anytime prior to the final exam.  All components apply
to the 20% homeworks portion of your grade except for the midterm, final,
and final project grade, which are marked accordingly.
In many cases, you need to point me at specific Git paths or URI's that
contain the files that show what you've done.
Your instructor will be glad to help you with any metrics you are having
trouble calculating, feel free to visit.
