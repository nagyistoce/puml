<h2>Group Phunctional </h2>
<h3>Homework #4
<br>Wednesday, February 22, 2012</h3>
<b>Part 1: Next Sprint</b>
<p>
Our first milestone is to have the use case diagram functional.  The deadline for this milestone is today, February 22, 2012.  
<br>As part of our next sprint, we will have several pieces of functionality complete to accomplish this goal.  One critical piece is we added connection points to connect objects, and deletion of objects is now a possibility.
</p>

<b>Part 2: Estimation</b>
<ul>
	<li>Function Points:   Currently we have approximately 150 function points, and we estimate we will end up with around 225 by the time the program is complete. 
	<li>SLOC:  currently at 1400 lines of code, we estimate the final product will have 6363 lines of code, based upon a careful analysis of what we have already produced, and what will need to be added based on what is left to develop.
</ul>
<b>Part 3: Pair Programming Exercise</b>
<br>
<p>This part of the homework assignment will be delayed until our previously scheduled pair programming exercise to be held Tuesday, February 28, 2012.

<li>My pair programming was done with Maxine Major on the night of Thursday, March 1 2012 from 6 pm to 8 pm.  Maxine and I worked on the collaboration diagram type for our project and anything directly relating to collaboration diagrams.  
          
<li>The experience started off with the both of us having to do more research into what objects a collaboration diagram would need, seeing as how neither of us had seen them before.  We made a list of the objects needed to work on this part as well as what seemed like sub-objects, or objects with multiple parts.  We then spent the rest of our time creating objects and testing them to make sure they worked.  We got about two and a half objects fully complete and ready to draw before we ran out of time and had to go do other things.  
<li>     While we were doing this we spent time swapping on and off of the computer to let the other person “drive”.  This allowed us to be more productive, than just letting one person drive, as is the case with paired programming.  
Overall I found the experience rather useful l and enjoyable.  I also think that it is an effective tool for brainstorming how to write the code as there are two minds working on the same problem.

<li>     My pair programming too place on March 1, 2012 with either Josh Armstrong or Jeremy Klas in little intervals (we had odd numbers).  We worked from 6-8pm on the state diagram graphics.

  <li>     First Josh gave me the grand tour of the program to make sure I understood how the various componens interacted with each other.  And then began to research the state diagram so that we knew what graphics we needed to create.  We then used and modified components of our default use case diagram to create the state diagram.  
<li>       We switched off depending on the tasks because some people knew more about different parts of the prograam more in-depth than others, which allowed us to quickle and efficiently create the graphics for the diagram (although we are still working on curved connecting arrows). Paired programming is a useful tool particularly for "coder's" block, and allows for much faster debugging!

  <li>I did the pair programming exercise with Zach Curtis on March 1 as part of our team's planned pair-programming workshop on March 1. Since our team decided to split up the remaining diagram types, Zach and I were tasked with the collaboration diagram. In order to start coding, we actually had to figure out what a collaboration diagram was. Then we agreed on which shapes and style of connector (all the elements) of the diagram we would need, prior to creating a foundation in our code for a collaboration diagram.
  <li>Pair programming was very useful for me to become familiar with shape creation in pUML.  Since I had not worked much in the code, it was very useful for Zach to "drive" first and show me which .cpp and .h files the shapes are created in, and how they link to other files in our project. On my turn to drive, I got to experiment with shape dimensions and the creation of a new shape. Even though we did not finish the diagram, we are well on our way to do so. The pair-programming part of the experiment wasn't just helpful in making design decisions, but there were times that I was able to point out changes that might have been overlooked, and vice-versa.

<li>    I worked with Nate on saving diagrams. We reviewed the roadmap for this task, and then we worked on creating a hook that can initiate the saving process.
<li>    The general setup was that we used QT creator on Nate's laptop. About half of the time we were looking for ways to bring up the QT save dialog. We had some problems with this dialog because it is a method in QtWidget. We finally discovered that our Document class inherited from QtObject. Once we revised the inheritance, this dialog worked. We spent most of our remaining time trying to code a proof of conecpt save event. We eventually were able to save a dummy text file. This is where we stopped for the night.
<li>    The experience was interesting for a number of reasons. First of all, Nate and I were able to glimpe the other's work flow. The actual amount of code written was relatively small, but we were trying to demonstrate a proof of concept, so most of our solutions were of the form of kludges. We wanted to know if we could retreive a file path string, or if we were looking at the wrong function. We wanted to know if we could save a plaintext file, and only later will we want to know if we can save a plaintext file using Qt builtins.
<li>    We were also able to introduce each other to some coding tools. I demonstrated the cpplint.py script, and Nate demonstrated the glorious mechanism of Qt Creator.

  <li>I did the pair programming exercise with David Wells on March 1 as part of our team's planned pair-programming workshop. Our goal was to copy the use case diagram and tweak it into the class diagram. Unfortunately, we spent 2 hours pair programming and were unable to even get a successful build with only an oval. Josh intervened and tried to assist but with no luck. Having no idea why our blatant copy/paste code failed, David instead gave me a tour of the existing code. I retried the copy/paste once I got home and it built, so we're blaming Jeremy's laptop for causing vtables errors.
  <li>Pair programming was very helpful for me because I was not very familiar with how our code had been restructured. Since David was proficient, he was able to show me specific examples which made it quick and easy to understand. Without David's help, I would have spent more than the 2 hours just figuring out existing code. Had we not had a computer related issue causing vtables errors, we would have more to show for our time, but I still got the benefit of a quick start guide to our code. Also, watching Josh and David try to solve the strange errors we were getting gave me my own ideas where to look for different parts of our source.
