<h2>Group Phunctional </h2>
<h3>Homework #4
<br>Wednesday, February 22, 2012</h3>
<b>Part 1: Next Sprint</b>
<p>
Our first milestone is to have the use case diagram functional.  The deadline for this milestone is today, February 22, 2012.  
<br>As part of our next sprint, we will have several pieces of functionality complete to accomplish this goal.  One critical piece is we added connection points to connect objects, and deletion of objects is now a possibility.
</p>

<b>Part 2: Estimation</b>
<ul>
	<li>Function Points:   Currently we have approximately 150 function points, and we estimate we will end up with around 225 by the time the program is complete. 
	<li>SLOC:  currently at 1400 lines of code, we estimate the final product will have 6363 lines of code, based upon a careful analysis of what we have already produced, and what will need to be added based on what is left to develop.
</ul>
<b>Part 3: Pair Programming Exercise</b>
<br>
<p>This part of the homework assignment will be delayed until our previously scheduled pair programming exercise to be held Tuesday, February 28, 2012.

<li>My pair programming was done with Maxine Major on the night of Thursday, March 1 2012 from 6 pm to 8 pm.  Maxine and I worked on the collaboration diagram type for our project and anything directly relating to collaboration diagrams.  
          
<li>The experience started off with the both of us having to do more research into what objects a collaboration diagram would need, seeing as how neither of us had seen them before.  We made a list of the objects needed to work on this part as well as what seemed like sub-objects, or objects with multiple parts.  We then spent the rest of our time creating objects and testing them to make sure they worked.  We got about two and a half objects fully complete and ready to draw before we ran out of time and had to go do other things.  
<li>     While we were doing this we spent time swapping on and off of the computer to let the other person “drive”.  This allowed us to be more productive, than just letting one person drive, as is the case with paired programming.  
Overall I found the experience rather useful l and enjoyable.  I also think that it is an effective tool for brainstorming how to write the code as there are two minds working on the same problem.

<li>     My pair programming too place on March 1, 2012 with either Josh Armstrong or Jeremy Klas in little intervals (we had odd numbers).  We worked from 6-8pm on the state diagram graphics.

  <li>     First Josh gave me the grand tour of the program to make sure I understood how the various componens interacted with each other.  And then began to research the state diagram so that we knew what graphics we needed to create.  We then used and modified components of our default use case diagram to create the state diagram.  
<li>       We switched off depending on the tasks because some people knew more about different parts of the prograam more in-depth than others, which allowed us to quickle and efficiently create the graphics for the diagram (although we are still working on curved connecting arrows). Paired programming is a useful tool particularly for "coder's" block, and allows for much faster debugging!
