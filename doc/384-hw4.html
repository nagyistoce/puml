<h2>Group Phunctional </h2>
<h3>Homework #4
<br>Wednesday, February 22, 2012</h3>
<b>Part 1: Next Sprint</b>
<p>
Our first milestone is to have the use case diagram functional.  The deadline for this milestone is today, February 22, 2012.  
<br>As part of our next sprint, we will have several pieces of functionality complete to accomplish this goal.  One critical piece is we added connection points to connect objects, and deletion of objects is now a possibility.
</p>

<b>Part 2: Estimation</b>
<ul>
	<li>Function Points:   Currently we have approximately 150 function points, and we estimate we will end up with around 225 by the time the program is complete. 
	<li>SLOC:  currently at 1400 lines of code, we estimate the final product will have 6363 lines of code, based upon a careful analysis of what we have already produced, and what will need to be added based on what is left to develop.
</ul>
<b>Part 3: Pair Programming Exercise</b>
<br>
<p>This part of the homework assignment will be delayed until our previously scheduled pair programming exercise to be held Tuesday, February 28, 2012.
