\subsubsection{Environmental Constraints.}
{
The pUML software poses no environmental constraints at this time .
}

\subsubsection{System Requirement Constraints.}
{
The pUML software will be designed to function on, Windows 7, and Linux. Cross platform functionality will minimize portability errors and allow for projects to be migrated between platforms with minimal difficulty.  However, the pUML software is not intended to be migrated to any other platforms with any guaranteeable level of functionality. \newline
The pUML software is also not intended to be utilized by multiple users. \newline
This release will not include several features which may be industry standard for UML diagram editors. These features would be incorporated into a later software release.
}

\subsubsection{User Characteristic Constraints.}
{
University of Idaho Computer Science students and faculty should be able
to reasonably understand and operate the pUML software.
}

VIEW]{\bfseries
DEVELOPER{\textquoteright}S ARCHITECTURAL VIEW}

\subsubsection[Developer{\textquoteright}s View
Identification]{\bfseries
Developer{\textquoteright}s View Identification}
{
This is the architecture of the program from the viewpoint of the
developer. The purpose is to give an overview of the details of the major
components of the architecture.}

{
In order to have the program be able to draw diagrams, a custom QWidget
is defined called the Canvas. The Canvas holds all the instantiations of
nodes and draws each one. It also creates the nodes by handling the
mouse click events. The toolbar and menu system lets the Canvas know
which type of object will be created next. The Canvas is a member of
the MainWindow class, which inherits from QMainWindow. }

\subsubsection[Developer{\textquoteright}s View Representation and
Description ]{Developer{\textquoteright}s View Representation and
Description }

{
The Canvas contains a vector container of
ObjectNodes. Each ObjectNode has a draw function which takes a QPainter
reference as an argument and draws the appropriate figure with the
QPainter. The program then defines it's own ObjectNodes, e.g. CircleNode
and DiamondNode, and pushes them into the vector. In this way the Canvas
can draw each of the nodes in the diagram. To create a new object, it
handles a mouse click event and creates a new object of the type specified
by a previous call to it's function to set a new object type. The new
object is pushed into the vector and then the draw function is called
on every node in that vector. When selecting a node to edit or delete,
the Canvas takes the X and Y coordinates of the click and translates that
into the index of the object selected. Then the Canvas can popup a menu
to edit the node or delete the node. }


\subsubsection{Developer{\textquoteright}s Architectural Rationale}

{
We decided to create a new QWidget for the Canvas so that it can handle
click events and have a paint function. We then decided to have the nodes
represented by a vector so that it can be easily iterated over and quickly
accessed by index. We decided to have the nodes be represented by specific
definitions of ObjectNodes so that they can all be pushed into the a vector
ObjectNodes. This way each of the nodes can define their own draw function,
as well private data such as radius for circles. This allows new objects to
be easily created. }

\clearpage
\subsection[USER{\textquoteright}S ARCHITECTURAL VIEW]
{\bfseries USER{\textquoteright}S ARCHITECTURAL VIEW}

\subsubsection{User{\textquoteright}s View Identification}
{
This is the viewpoint of the program from the viewpoint of the user.
From this viewpoint, there are three major components of the
program: the Canvas, the Toolbar and the Menu. }

\subsubsection{User{\textquoteright}s View Representation and
Description }
{
The menu and the toolbar have redundant functionality. The toolbar provides
quick access to certain menu items, such as available objects and connectors. The canvas provides a space for the user to place objects and connectors during creation of a UML diagram. The pUML software also provides options for the user to save and load pUML UML diagrams.

{
The user will be able to select objects from the toolbar and place them on the Canvas.
}

\paragraph[Input for this Feature]{Input for this Feature}
{
The user will click on a shape on the toolbar.  The first subsequent click of the mouse over the Canvas area will place the selected shape at that location.
}

\paragraph{Output for this Feature}
{
The object will be placed on the Canvas, at a location of the user{\textquoteright}s choosing, provided there are no collisions with other objects.
}

\paragraph{Feature Process to Convert Input to Output}
{
The mouse click on a shape on the toolbar will lock that shape in memory.
The subsequent mouse click on the Canvas will send the shape information from the toolbar to the Canvas.  
The Canvas will draw the shape at the specific coordinates of the mouse click, and will update the list of existing shapes on the Canvas for that particular diagram.
}

\paragraph{Design Constraints and Performance Requirements of this Feature}
{
The object will not be permitted to be placed at an overlapping location with another object.

\subsubsection{Detailed Design for Feature: Select an Object}

\paragraph[\ Introduction/Purpose of this Feature]
{\ Introduction/Purpose of this Feature}
{
User wishes to select an object, either for editing purposes or to move the object.
}

\paragraph[Input for this Feature]{Input for this Feature}
{
User clicks on the object.
}

\paragraph{Output for this Feature}
{
The canvas identifies and displays the object as selected.
}

\paragraph{Feature Process to Convert Input to Output}
{
The user clicks on an object. Canvas stores the coordinates of the click and sends them to nodes to test whether an object resides at those coordinates on the Canvas.  nodes returns true or false. Canvas updates the index of selected items, and draws this list back to nodes.
}

\paragraph{Design Constraints and Performance Requirements of this Feature}
{
Actions that may be based upon an object{\textquoteright}s selection have not been developed at this time.

The program displays a dialog box with object properties the user may modify, and updates the program with changes.
}

\paragraph{Feature Process to Convert Input to Output}
{
User right clicks on an object on the Canvas. The Canvas determines whether an object resides at those coordinates. If valid, the Canvas sets that object, and activates QMenu, which in turn shows the Dialog for the selected object.
The user modifies the object properties per the Dialog.  The Dialog sends the updated object information back to the Canvas.

This feature allows the user to place a connecting line between two objects.
}

\paragraph[Input for this Feature]{Input for this Feature}
{
The user selects a connector shape from the toolbar, and then selects two objects between which to place the connector.
}

\paragraph{Output for this Feature}
{
A connector line is drawn between the two objects the user selected.
}

\paragraph{Feature Process to Convert Input to Output}
{
User clicks on a connector shape in the Toolbar.  
The Canvas gets the connector information from the Toolbar.  
The user clicks on an object.
The Canvas verifies that an object exists at that location, identifies the closest connection point on the object to the click, and stores this information.
The user clicks on a second object on the Canvas.  
The Canvas verifies that an object exists at the second location, identifies the closest connection point on the object to the click, and stores this information.  
The Canvas draws the connector at the coordinates of the user{\textquoteright}s click on the Canvas.  
Canvas updates list of objects on the Canvas.  
}

\paragraph{Design Constraints and Performance Requirements of this Feature}
{
More than one connector may not connect the same two objects.
\\A connector may not be placed if two different objects have not been selected to place the connector between.
