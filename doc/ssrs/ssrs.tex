\clearpage\section[OVERALL DESCRIPTION]{\bfseries
OVERALL DESCRIPTION}

\subsection[PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE]{\bfseries
PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE}
{
This product is independent of any other product, and as such, is self-contained.
}

\subsubsection[PRODUCT FUNCTIONS]
{\bfseries PRODUCT FUNCTIONS}

This product's primary function is to allow the user to create UML diagrams, edit existing diagrams, and store and retrieve them.
\newline Features to be tested include all objects, connectors, and associated functionality, Open/Save functionality, and all diagram types load properly. The specific requirements for the UML diagram editor are itemized below.

\bigskip

\subsubsection[MENU OPTIONS MENU MAINWINDOW]
{\bfseries MENU OPTIONS MENU MAINWINDOW} 
{
\begin{itemize}
\item Options window appears at pUML startup.
\item When the options window is closed with no selections made, the pUML main window remains.
\item When "New" is selected, options window appears.
\item When "Open" is selected, an explorer window appears.
\item When "Save" is selected: refer to subsection 2.1.6.
\item When "Save As.." is selected: refer to subsection 2.1.6.
\item When Exit is clicked:
\begin{itemize}
\item If all currently open diagrams are saved, pUML exits.
\item If any open diagram is not saved, refer to subsection 2.1.6.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\subsubsection[OBJECTS]{\bfseries OBJECTS} 

All objects should perform or have the following tasks performed on them in a consistent manner in the following cases: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Objects can be created.
	\item Objects can be deleted.
\begin{itemize}
\item Any associated connectors must also be deleted.
\item All associated text and descriptions must also be deleted.
\end{itemize}
	\item Objects can be selected.
	\item Objects can be de-selected.
	\item Objects can be moved after they have been placed
\begin{itemize}
\item Objects moved retain the new location after the associated diagram is saved, closed, and restored.
\item All text and descriptions associated with the object move with the object to the same location in relation to the object.
\end{itemize}
\item Objects can accept an indefinite number of connection lines.
\item The object`s properties may be modified an indefinite number of times.
\item The object will automatically resize to fit the contents.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\subsubsection[CONNECTORS]{\bfseries CONNECTORS}

All connectors should perform or have the following tasks performed on them in a consistent manner in the following cases: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Connectors can be created.
\begin{itemize}
\item Only one connector may exist between any two objects.
\item Only one self connector may exist per object.
\end{itemize}
\item Connectors can be deleted.
\item Connectors can be selected.
\item Connectors can be de-selected.
\item Connectors cannnot be moved from one object and placed onto another. 
\item If an object a connector is attached to moves, the connector's endpoint attached to that object will move with that object. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Connectors moved retain the new configuration with the same integrity as the previous configuration.
\item All text and descriptions associated with the connector move with the connector to the same location in relation to the connector as before.
\end{itemize}
\item The connector's properties may be modified.
\begin{itemize}
\item Line description may be modified an indefinite number of times.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\subsubsection[OPEN]{\bfseries OPEN}

Once the pUML software has been launched, files may be opened if the following criteria are met:

\begin{itemize}
\item The file type is of pUML type.
\item The file name is legitimate.
\item The file is not already open in pUML.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Note: The cases listed above are ensured by QT, and will not be tested.
\newline 


If the user opens a pUML diagram file, restore functionality will occur as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the pUML software is not already loaded, it will load.
\item A new tab will open, and the previously saved diagram will appear in the tab.
\item The toolbar is updated with that diagram's objects and connectors.
\item All objects and connectors in the file are in the exact same state and configuration as when the file had been previously saved.
\item The file may be modified (edited).
\begin{itemize}
\item Objects may be added or removed.
\item Connectors may be added or removed.
\end{itemize}
\item The file may be saved.
\item The file may be closed.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\subsubsection[SAVE]{\bfseries SAVE/SAVE AS}
{
The Save and Save As functions may be invoked if the following criteria are met: 
\begin{itemize}
\item A diagram is open in pUML.
\end{itemize}
}

\bigskip

Save/Save As functionality:
\newline
{
\begin{itemize}
\item A diagram may be saved regardless of whether it is new or previously saved.
\item A diagram may be saved whether or not it has been modified. (e.g., a blank diagram may be saved)
\item If a diagram has been previously saved, pUML will automatically write over the saved file's contents. The modified diagram will be saved at the original location of the diagram under the original name.
\item If a diagram has not been previously saved, Save As will automatically occur.
\begin{itemize}
\item The Save-As dialog will load.
\item The user must select an appropriate file name and storage location. 
\item The diagram will be stored at the location and under the name the user has entered.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\bigskip


\subsubsection[DIAGRAM TYPES]{\bfseries DIAGRAM TYPES}

\begin{itemize}
\item pUML diagrams may be of only one diagram type. (There are no legitimate UML diagrams that combine elements of more than one diagram type)
\item Diagram-specific objects and connectors will be the only ones displayed in the toolbar for a specific diagram type.
\item The type of the diagram will be saved with a diagram file, so that a diagram may not be loaded into a tab with a different diagram type.
\end{itemize}


\bigskip

\subsubsection[TAB FUNCTIONALITY]{\bfseries TAB FUNCTIONALITY}

\begin{itemize}
\item Except for the initial loading of pUML (initial options window view), at least one tab must be open at any time.
\item If all tabs are closed, pUML exits.
\item If the diagram loaded into a tab is saved, clicking the ``X'' will close the tab.
\item If the diagram loaded into a tab is not saved, and the ``X'' is clicked: refer to subsection 2.1.6.
\item pUML will permit an indefinite number of tabs to be opened at any time, but this may consume a disproportionate amount of resources.
\end{itemize}



\bigskip




}

\subsection[USER CHARACTERISTICS]{\bfseries
USER CHARACTERISTICS}
{
The intended user for the pUML software are software engineers and computer science students with a prior knowledge of UML. This user is already familiar with computers and generally has some experience in programming languages.
}

\subsection[CONSTRAINTS]{\bfseries
CONSTRAINTS}
{
Since the pUML project was developed as a class assignment,
further development of this project will halt if the University of Idaho faculty overseeing this project decide that this project should to no longer continue.
}

\subsection[ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES]{\bfseries
ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES}
{
The requirements for the pUML software were decided upon by University of Idaho Computer Science Department faculty.  Any further direction this project may take will depend on their decisions. As of this revision, it is currently undecided if this project will be maintained after the corresponding course has concluded. 
}




\subsection[SYSTEM LEVEL (NON{}-FUNCTIONAL)
REQUIREMENTS]{\bfseries
SYSTEM LEVEL (NON-FUNCTIONAL) REQUIREMENTS}

\subsubsection[Site dependencies]{\bfseries
Site dependencies}
{
The pUML software has no dependencies on any external resources, such as internet access, etc..
Any modern operating system (2008+) should be sufficient to support the pUML software,
and since this software is cross-platform, there should be no complications.
}

\subsubsection[Safety, security and privacy requirements]{\bfseries
Safety, security and privacy requirements}
{
There are no safety, security or privacy requirements at this time.
}

\subsubsection[Performance requirements]{\bfseries
Performance requirements}
{
This software is to be supported on one terminal per install, and since there are no current
 limitations applying to product distribution, it may be installed on a theoretically infinite 
number of terminals. This software is not designed to be remotely accessed, and as a result, 
one user per session is recommended as well.  The software has not been tested to determine 
efficient transaction times as of the date of this SSRS publication.
}

\subsubsection[System and software quality]{\bfseries System
and software quality}
{
The fully developed software should be available for use and reliably handle all requests 98 
percent of the time.  The software can currently handle saving, diagram selection, allow for 
editing of multiple diagrams at a time, diagram component deletion, diagram component labeling, 
and loading of saved diagrams.
}

\subsubsection[Packaging and delivery requirements]{\bfseries
Packaging and delivery requirements}
{
The executable system and all associated documentation (i.e., SSRS, SSDD, code listing, test plan (data and results), and user manual) will be delivered to the customer on CD{\textquoteright}s and/or via email, as
specified by the customer at time of delivery. \ Although the user will be kept informed of progress via the Mercurial repository throughout the
system development process, the final, edited version of the above
documents will accompany the final, accepted version of the executable
system.}

\subsubsection[Personnel{}-related requirements]{\bfseries
Personnel-related requirements}
{
The system under development has no special personnel-related
characteristics. }

\subsubsection[Training{}-related requirements]{\bfseries
Training-related requirements}
{
A user manual will be included in this project to aid users who have difficulty intuiting the proper action to produce the corresponding outcome.
}

\subsubsection[Logistics{}-related requirements]{\bfseries
Logistics-related requirements}
{
The pUML software is intended for use on University of Idaho Computer Science department computers as well as computer science students' personal computers including, at a minimum, operating systems Windows 7, Mac OSX, and Linux.
Any minimum hardware requirements lie outside the scope of the resources available,
and there will be no software application dependencies at the time of release.
}

\subsubsection[Precedence and criticality of requirements]{\bfseries
Precedence and criticality of requirements}
{
System and software quality are the primary focus of our software development. All additional features and functionality are secondary.

\subsubsection[System feature: [Project management tasks suite]{\bfseries System feature: Project management tasks suite}

\paragraph[\ Introduction/Purpose for These Features] 
{\bfseries Introduction/Purpose for These Features}
{
Several processes are required to manage projects. These include the saving of files, loading projects from files, and deleting projects.}


\paragraph[Input/Output sequence for this feature]
{\bfseries Input/Output sequence for These Features}
{
The user selects the ``File'' pull down menu at the top left corner of his or her screen. The options currently supported are ``New'', ``Open'', ``Copy As'', ``Save'', ``Save As'', and ``Delete Project''. }

\subparagraph{New}
{
This creates a new project space. }

\subparagraph{Open}
{
This opens a previously saved project. The user shall be presented with a dialog option to save the previous project. Once completing this dialog, the previous project will be closed and the selected project will be opened.}

\subparagraph{Save}
{
This saves the current state of the project into an XML that can later be used to recreate the project state. If the current project does not have a name, the ``Save'' option will be an alias for the ``Save As'' option.}

\subparagraph{Save As}
{
This creates a new project space and then saves the project state into the new project. In contrast with ``Copy As'', this option does not affect the previous project. }

\subparagraph{Delete Project}
{
This deletes the current project and all files within the project folder. The user shall be presented with a confirmation dialog before this action is completed. Upon completion, a blank and unnamed project will be active in the project window. }
