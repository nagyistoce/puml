\section[Introduction]{\rmfamily\bfseries
Introduction}

\subsection[IDENTIFICATION]{\rmfamily\bfseries
IDENTIFICATION}
{
The software system being considered for development is referred to as Phunctional UML Editor (pUML). \ The customer providing specifications
for the system is Professor Bruce Bolden at the University of Idaho. \ The ultimate
customer, or end-user, of the system will be University of Idaho Computer Science students and/or faculty. \ This is a new project effort, so the version under development is version 0.0.}

\subsection[PURPOSE]{\rmfamily\bfseries
PURPOSE}
{
The purpose of the system under development is to create and store UML diagrams.
\ While the system will be used by Computer Science students at the University of Idaho,
this document is intended to be read and understood by UICS software
designers and coders.}

\subsection[SCOPE]{\rmfamily\bfseries
SCOPE}
{
The pUML software was conceptualized as a Software Engineering class project, and was launched in September 2011 .  The pUML project is as of the date of this SSRS publication, incomplete, and has yet no aquirers, users, support agencies at this time. Upon completion, the pUML software will be available only for distribution to the University of Idaho Computer Science department, and will be supported by the development team. }

OVERVIEW AND RESTRICTIONS}
{
This document is for limited release only to UI CS personnel working on
the project.}


\bigskip

{
Section 2 of this document describes the system under development from a
holistic point of view. \ Functions, characteristics, constraints,
assumptions, dependencies, and overall requirements are defined from
the system-level perspective.}


\bigskip

{
Section 3 of this document describes the specific requirements of the
system being developed. \ Interfaces, features, and specific
requirements are enumerated and described to a degree sufficient for a
knowledgeable designer or coder to begin crafting an architectural
solution to the proposed system.}


\bigskip

{
Section 4 provides the requirements traceability information for the
project. \ Each feature of the system is indexed by the SSRS
requirement number and linked to its SDD and test references.}


\bigskip

{
Sections 5 and up are appendices including original information and
communications used to create this document.}











\clearpage\section[OVERALL DESCRIPTION]{\rmfamily\bfseries
OVERALL DESCRIPTION}

\subsection[PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE]{\rmfamily\bfseries
PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE}
{
This product is independent of any other product, and as such, is self-contained.
}

\subsection[PRODUCT FUNCTIONS]{\rmfamily\bfseries
PRODUCT FUNCTIONS}
{
This product's primary function is to allow the user to create UML diagrams.  
The program will allow the user to create new diagrams, edit existing diagrams, and save them to access later.
}

\subsection[USER CHARACTERISTICS]{\rmfamily\bfseries
USER CHARACTERISTICS}
{
The intended user for the pUML software are software engineers and computer science students, 
with a need to organize the parts of the software engineering project. This user is already 
familiar with computers and generally has some experience in programming languages.
}

\subsection[CONSTRAINTS]{\rmfamily\bfseries
CONSTRAINTS}
{
Since the pUML project was developed as a class assignment,
further development of this project will halt if the University of Idaho
faculty overseeing this project decide that this project should to no longer continue.
}

\subsection[ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES]{\rmfamily\bfseries
ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES}
{
The requirements for the pUML software were decided upon by University of Idaho Computer Science
Department faculty.  Any further direction this project may take will depend on their decisions. 
It is currently undecided if this project will be maintained after the corresponding course has
concluded. 
}




\subsection[SYSTEM LEVEL (NON{}-FUNCTIONAL)
REQUIREMENTS]{\rmfamily\bfseries
SYSTEM LEVEL (NON-FUNCTIONAL) REQUIREMENTS}

\subsubsection[Site dependencies]{\rmfamily\bfseries
Site dependencies}
{
The pUML software has no dependencies on any external resources, such as internet access, etc..
Any modern operating system (2008+) should be sufficient to support the pUML software,
and since this software is cross-platform, there should be no complications.
}

\subsubsection[Safety, security and privacy requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries
Safety, security and privacy requirements}
{
There are no safety, security or privacy requirements at this time.
}

\subsubsection[Performance requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries
Performance requirements}
{
This software is to be supported on one terminal per install, and since there are no current
 limitations applying to product distribution, it may be installed on a theoretically infinite 
number of terminals. This software is not designed to be remotely accessed, and as a result, 
one user per session is recommended as well.  The software has not been tested to determine 
efficient transaction times as of the date of this SSRS publication.
}

\subsubsection[System and software quality]{\rmfamily\bfseries System
and software quality}
{
The fully developed software should be available for use and reliably handle all requests 98 
percent of the time.  The software can currently handle saving, diagram selection, allow for 
editing of multiple diagrams at a time, diagram component deletion, diagram component labeling, 
and loading of saved diagrams.
}

\subsubsection[Packaging and delivery requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries
Packaging and delivery requirements}
{
The executable system and all associated documentation (i.e., SSRS, SDD,
code listing, test plan (data and results), and user manual) will be
delivered to the customer on CD{\textquoteright}s and/or via email, as
specified by the customer at time of delivery. \ Although the user will be 
kept informed of progress via hg throughout the
system development process, the final, edited version of the above
documents will accompany the final, accepted version of the executable
system.}

\subsubsection[Personnel{}-related requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries
Personnel-related requirements}
{
The system under development has no special personnel-related
characteristics. }

\subsubsection[Training{}-related requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries
Training-related requirements}
{
A user manual will be included in this project to aid users who have 
difficulty intuiting the proper action to produce the corresponding outcome.}

\subsubsection[Logistics{}-related requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries
Logistics-related requirements}
{
The pUML software is intended for use on University of Idaho Computer Science department computers as well as computer science students' personal computers including, at a minimum, operating systems Windows 7, Mac OSX, and Linux.
Any minimum hardware requirements lie outside the scope of the resources available,
and there will be no software application dependencies at the time of release.
}

\subsubsection[Precedence and criticality of requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries
Precedence and criticality of requirements}
{
System and software quality are our main priorities, even if this implies poor 
user experience until these priorities are accomplished.}

\subsubsection[System feature: [Project management tasks suite]{\rmfamily\bfseries System
feature: Project management tasks suite}

\paragraph[\ Introduction/Purpose of this feature]{\foreignlanguage{english}{\ }\foreignlanguage{english}{Introduction/Purpose of this feature}}
{
Several processes are required to manage projects. These include the saving of files, loading projects from files, and deleting projects.}


\paragraph[Input/Output sequence for this feature]{\rmfamily\bfseries
Input/Output sequence for this feature}
{
The user selects the ``File'' pull down menu at the top left corner of his or her screen. The options currently supported are ``New'', ``Open'', ``Revert'', ``Copy As'', ``Save'', ``Save As'', and ``Delete Project''. }

\subparagraph{New}
{
\\ This creates a new project space. }

\subparagraph{Open}
{
\\ This opens a previously saved project. The user shall be presented with a dialog option to save the previous project. Once completing this dialog, the previous project will be closed and the selected project will be opened.}

\subparagraph{Copy As}
{
\\ This creates a new project space. First, the program will be saved. Then the user shall be presented with a dialog to choose a unique name for the new project space. Once completing this dialog, a copy of the previous project will be cloned into the new project space. The previous project shall be closed and the new project shall be opened.}

\subparagraph{Save}
{
\\ This saves the current state of the project into an XML that can later be used to recreate the project state. If the current project does not have a name, the ``Save'' option will be an alias for the ``Save As'' option.}

\subparagraph{Save As}
{
\\ This creates a new project space and then saves the project state into the new project. In contrast with ``Copy As'', this option does not affect the previous project. }

\subparagraph{Delete Project}
{
\\ This deletes the current project and all files within the project folder. The user shall be presented with a confirmation dialog before this action is completed. Upon completion, a blank and unnamed project will be active in the project window. }
